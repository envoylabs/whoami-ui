        PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE ACQUIRING A DENS
        TOKEN.

      <p className="p-2">Overview</p>
      <p className="p-2">What&lsquo;s in this Privacy Statement</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        This Statement explains how your personal information (also known as
        personal data) may be used or processed when registering, managing and
        using the Decentralised Name Service (DENS) non-fungible name token
        (Token).{' '}
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        The DENS and details on how to register a Token can be found at

      </p>
      <p className="p-2">Who we are and how to contact us</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        DENS is a decentralized application (dApp) and operates subject to rules
        encoded on the Juno Blockchain and is maintained by [Moloch Systems Ltd
        (a company registered in England and Wales)] and its contributors (We,
        us and our).

      <p className="p-2">To contact us please use email info@moloch.systems</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        By using the dApp you understand this Privacy Statement applies
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        If you do not accept the scope of this Privacy Statement then you must
        not use the dApp or register a Token.{' '}

      <p className="p-2">What is DENS</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        Please refer to our DENS Terms of Use for information on how DENS
        operates.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        What is personal information (also known as personal identifiable
        information/ personal data){' '}
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        Personal information is information that relates to an identified or
        identifiable individual. For example, this includes name, address, age,
        but may also include your Keplr or other wallet public key if it belongs
        to an individual person.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">We do not collect your personal information</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        No personal information is collected or held by us, or other authors,
        publishers or maintainers DENS. We take no action based on, nor make any
        use of, the personal information that you provide. The only personal
        information we have sight of is that which you choose to make publicly
        available on the DENS when minting a Token.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        We will never ask you to hand over private keys or sensitive data.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        We collect no data about you or your interaction with DENS. This
        includes not collecting any technical information about you or your
        device, through using cookies, tracking or analytics technologies on the
        dApp.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        Because of this, we do not believe we are data controllers under the
        GDPR, or an equivalent under other laws and regulations worldwide.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">The impact of blockchain</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        Because DENS operates on the Juno blockchain, this means that all
        transactions in relation to DENS are recorded permanently on the
        blockchain and we have no control over your personal information once it
        is stored on the blockchain.{' '}
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        Therefore, by interacting with the blockchain via DENS, your
        transactions, wallet address and Tokens are publicly visible to any
        other user and to the public. This is normal for any blockchain-based
        dApp, but if you are uncomfortable with this, then burn your tokens and
        cease interacting with DENS and the underlying contract.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        However, please note that all prior transactions will still be recorded
        and available on the Juno blockchain forever.{' '}
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">You have control over your personal information</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        We focus on ensuring you have control over your personal information. We
        do this by:
      </p>
      <p className="p-2"> • Not collecting your personal information</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Allowing you to choose whether to engage with DENS and the blockchain
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Allowing you to choose the name/configuration of your Token
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Allowing you to control transfer, use and destruction of your Token
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">How you can manage use of your personal information</p>
      <p className="p-2">
        To cease using DENS, simply burn your Tokens and disconnect your wallet.
        No contract admin can access, change, or burn your Tokens for you.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        The source code for the project can be audited to confirm this is the
        case.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        What if I use personal information when minting a Token?
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        Please note that if you include any personal information within your
        Token name/configuration then this will be publicly available on the
        blockchain forever. We have no control over this because the smart
        contract system on the Juno blockchain is intended to provide a
        permanent record of ownership of the Token.
