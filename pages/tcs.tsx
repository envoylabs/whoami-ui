      <h2 className="text-4xl p-4 font-bold">TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</h2>

      <p className="p-2">
        The Decentralized Name Service (referred to in these terms as
        &lsquo;DENS&rsquo;) is a distributed application, or dApp, that runs on
        the Juno network, although it can be run on any CosmWasm-enabled chain.
        It runs on a custom smart contract developed and maintained by Envoy
        Labs. The Smart Contract(s) that power The Decentralized Name Service,
        and the user-interface are referred to in these terms as the
        &lsquo;App&rsquo;. The DENS contributors and Envoy Labs are collectively
        referred to as its &lsquo;Authors&lsquo;. DENS allows users to mint
        &lsquo;Names&rsquo;, also referred to as Tokens, CosmWasm Tokens, or
        NFTs. These use the CosmWasm NFT standard.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-4xl p-4 font-bold">AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>

      <p className="p-2">
        You agree that by accessing the App, you have read, understood, and
        agree to be bound by all of these Terms and Conditions. If you do not
        agree with all of these Terms and Conditions, then you are expressly
        prohibited from using the App and you must discontinue use immediately.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
        App from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
        reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes
        or modifications to these Terms and Conditions at any time and for any
        reason.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        We will alert you about any changes by updating the &lsquo;Last
        updated&rsquo; date of these Terms and Conditions, and you waive any
        right to receive specific notice of each such change.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms and
        Conditions to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will
        be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes
        in any revised Terms and Conditions by your continued use of the App
        after the date such revised Terms and Conditions are posted.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        The information provided on the App is not intended for distribution to
        or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such
        distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which
        would subject us to any registration requirement within such
        jurisdiction or country.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the App from other
        locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
        compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
        applicable.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        To use the application, you must install a browser extension wallet
        called Keplr. No other integration path is supported or advised. You
        understand that your wallet public address will be made publicly visible
        whenever you engage in a transaction on the App. We neither own nor
        control Keplr, the Juno Network, or any other third party site, product,
        or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of
        enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be
        liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we
        be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your
        transactions or any other interaction with any third parties.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-4xl p-4 font-bold">DISCLAIMER</h2>

      <p className="p-2">
        DENS, and its authors are free of any liability regarding Tokens minted
        using this App, and any use made of them. Tokens minted on DENS, whether
        CosmWasm or otherwise, their projects, their teams, their use of Tokens
        (as well as anything related to Tokens) are in no way connected to DENS
        or its authors.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        Any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely
        through the Juno Network via Keplr. You are solely responsible for
        determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT and Token-related
        transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that
        apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        There are risks associated with blockchain technology, including, but
        not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections,
        the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third
        parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your
        wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for
        any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays
        you may experience when using the Juno Network, however caused.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
        cryptocurrencies, and Tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or
        policies may materially adversely affect the development of the CosmWasm
        and Juno ecosystems, and therefore the potential utility or value of
        CosmWasm NFTs. Upgrades to CosmWasm, or a change in how Tokens are
        specified in CosmWasm may have unintended, adverse effects on all
        blockchains using CW NFT standards.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        Standards in the CosmWasm ecosystem are still in flux, and the Authors
        make no claims about interoperability, future support, or adoption of
        either CosmWasm, CosmWasm Tokens, CosmWasm NFTs or any Tokens minted via
        DENS.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        The App may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources
        (collectively, &lsquo;External Sites&rsquo;), which are provided solely
        as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External
        Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the
        availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any
        advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any
        External Sites. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not
        liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the
        availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of
        any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence
        of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available
        from, any External Sites.

      <h2 className="text-4xl p-4 font-bold">PRIVACY</h2>

      <p className="p-2">
        DENS and its team collect no data about you or your interaction with the
        App. No tracking, no analytics.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        By interacting with the blockchain via DENS your transactions, wallet
        address and Tokens are publicly visible to any other user and to the
        public. This is normal for any blockchain-based dApp, but if you are
        uncomfortable with this, then burn your tokens and cease interacting
        with DENS and the underlying contract.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        No additional information is collected or held by DENS, its authors,
        publishers or maintainers other than what is publicly available on the
        blockchain, and no action is taken by the App or its Authors based on
        the data that you provide.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        We will never ask you to hand over private keys or sensitive data.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        To cease using DENS, simply burn your Tokens and disconnect your wallet.
        No contract admin can access, change, or burn your Tokens for you.
      </p>

      <p className="p-2">
        The source code for the project can be audited to confirm this is the
        case.
