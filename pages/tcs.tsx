      <p class="p-2">DECENTRALISED NAME SERVICE (DENS)- TERMS OF INVOLVEMENT</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACQUIRING A DENS
        TOKEN.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> 1. Overview</p>
      <p class="p-2">What's in these Terms?</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        These Terms set out the rules for registering, managing and using the
        Decentralised Name Service (DENS) non-fungible name token (Token). The
        DENS permits you to mint a Token, which is in the CosmWasm CW721
        on-chain metadata extension NFT standard format.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        The DENS and details on how to register a Token at https://dens.sh (DENS
        Domain).
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">Who we are and how to contact us</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        DENS is a distributed application (dApp) and operates subject to rules
        encoded on the Juno Blockchain known as a Smart Contract System/SCS
        (located at
        juno1mf309nyvr4k4zv0m7m40am9n7nqjf6gupa0wukamwmhgntqj0gxs9hqlrr) and is
        maintained by [Moloch Systems Ltd (company registered in England and
        Wales)] and its contributors (We, us and our).
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">To contact us please use email [info@envoys.io]</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        By using the dApp you accept these terms and agree to comply with them
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the dApp or
        register a Token. You will need to accept these terms on first use and
        if we update these Terms.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">These Terms were last updated on 2022-09-01</p>
      <p class="p-2">Smart Contract System versus these Terms</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        It is our intention that these Terms capture the operation of the SCS
        for DENS and, therefore, may be relied upon in relation to your
        interaction with DENS.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        However, it is the nature of distributed applications that they will
        evolve and we may update the infrastructure, code and SCS from time to
        time. Therefore, if there is any difference between these Terms and the
        SCS, the SCS will take priority when determining rights and obligations
        of you and us.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        We will endeavour to ensure these Terms are kept up to date and may vary
        these terms at our choice by posting the updated terms on DENS.{' '}

      <p class="p-2">Please see our Privacy Statement here.</p>
      <p class="p-2"> 2. Risks and liability</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        You confirm the following when being involved with the dApp
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> • You have read and understood these Terms.</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Tokens minted on DENS, whether CosmWasm or otherwise, or your use of
        Tokens are in no way connected to DENS . By using this service you
        understand you are doing so at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • You have an understanding of how cryptographic tokens, and other
        blockchain-based software systems operate.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • You waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or a
        classwide arbitration against us or any entity involved with the
        creation or maintenance of DENS.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • You will not use the Token, or use DENS, for any illegal purpose in
        your jurisdiction
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • You understand that token receipt does not give you any right or
        interest in DENS or any company/entity.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • You understand that, other than as set out in these Terms, all other
        express or implied warranties in relation to the DENS and Tokens are
        excluded to the extent permitted by law, and they are provided on an “as
        is” basis.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> • The Token is registered to you personally.</p>
      <p class="p-2">You understand the following risks will apply</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Regulatory risk: blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction
        and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing
        regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain
        technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current
        setup of the Smart Contract System and which may require substantial
        modifications to the Smart Contract System, including its termination,
        closure and/or the loss of Tokens, for example changes in anti-money
        laundering regulations.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Risk of software weaknesses: the Smart Contract System and DENS are
        always evolving and being developed. There is no warranty or assurance
        that interaction will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an
        inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses,
        vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Keplr, Juno and third party exchanges. We neither own nor control
        Keplr or any other compatible wallet, the Juno Network, or any other
        third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or
        use for the purpose of enabling you to use DENS (including those linked
        from the dApp). We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any
        such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may
        suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with
        any third parties.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Risk of information and personal data always being available: the
        nature of blockchain means that any information, including personal
        data, related to an exchange or possession of Tokens, will be recorded
        permanently on the blockchain. You should not register for a Token or
        use the dApp if this is not acceptable to you (see our Privacy Statement
        for more info).
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Risk of weakness in the underlying JUNO blockchain: there is a risk
        that as an open source project, any contributor to the Juno blockchain
        could introduce weaknesses or bugs into Juno, which may impact the
        operation of DENS.{' '}
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Risk of abandonment / lack of success: the management of DENS may be
        abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the
        public. You therefore understand and accept that there is no warranty or
        assurance that DENS dApp will continue.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Risk of Attack. the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying
        software application and software platform (i.e. the Juno blockchain)
        may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals including, but
        not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
        consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any such
        successful attacks could result in theft or loss of Tokens, adversely
        impact the ability to operate DENS, or the use or functionality of the
        Tokens.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        • Risks Arising from Taxation: the tax characterization of
        tokens/cryptoassets is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in
        connection with acquisition, storage, holding and use of Tokens.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">Limitations on Liability</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no circumstances
        shall we or any contributor,, be liable for any indirect, special,
        incidental or consequential loss of any kind (including, but not limited
        to, loss of revenue, income, business or profits, loss of contract or
        depletion of goodwill, loss of anticipated savings, loss of use or data,
        or damages for business interruption or any like loss) arising out of or
        in any way related to the acquisition, storage, transfer or use of the
        Tokens, use of DENS or otherwise related to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        We exclude liability for any loss, damage or claim arising from holding
        a Token any use made of them, including accidental loss, transfer or
        theft by another user, either arising from technical reasons or fraud.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> 3. DENS Operation</p>
      <p class="p-2">Obtaining a Token</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        The SCS is designed to create and issue its own proprietary Tokens,
        which are available by connecting your Keplr crypto asset wallet with
        DENS. Instructions on integrating are available here.{' '}
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        Once your wallet is connected you will be able to engage via the SCS in
        order to exchange Juno tokens (in the amount detailed when obtaining the
        token) for the Token. At this time the DENS NFT will be registered on
        the SCS (minted) including the name details/configuration for Token
        which you have provided.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        Any Juno tokens exchanged will be received by our wallet and then be our
        sole and exclusive property and you understand and agree that you have
        no right or interest to such Juno tokens once the exchange has been
        made.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">Technical Requirements</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        To use DENS, you must install a browser extension wallet called Keplr.
        No other integration path is currently supported or advised. You
        understand that your wallet public address will be made publicly visible
        whenever you engage in a transaction or interaction with the App.{' '}
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">Token management and primary name</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        Once a Token has been minted, you will own the Token as an NFT and will
        be able to transfer it to a third party (though note they will be
        subject to these Terms), edit the Token or burn a Token/name.{' '}
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        Please note that even if you transfer, edit or burn a Token, your
        original transaction and name details will be permanently recorded in
        the SCS blockchain (Juno), therefore you should be careful about what
        personal information you include. Please refer to our Privacy Statement
        for more information.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        Whilst it is possible for your wallet to store multiple Tokens, in order
        for us to manage the dApp we will require a primary alias to be set (see
        www.dens.sh/integrating). If you do not set one, then we will assign a
        primary alias based on the most recent Token minted.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> 4. Intellectual Property</p>
      <p class="p-2">SCS code</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        The SCS is built on the Juno blockchain on an open source basis and, as
        such, is free to be viewed, copy and used by you or any third party
        according to the terms set out in its licence.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">DENS content</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        We are the owner or the licensee of all intellectual property rights in
        the content, logos, trade marks, images or other materials displayed on
        the dApp. These works are protected by copyright and trade mark laws and
        treaties around the world. All rights are reserved. You must not use any
        of this content other than in relation to obtaining and using a Token
        via the dApp.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> 5. Token Status</p>
      <p class="p-2">You will not have ownership of DENS or our business</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        ​Holding Tokens does not represent or constitute an equity ownership
        stake, share, or equivalent in DENS, or any public or private company,
        corporation, or other entity in any jurisdiction. The Tokens are NFTs
        and are not a financial instrument or other regulated investment. Tokens
        are only for use in connection with DENS under these terms and SCS and
        do not entitle any holder of Tokens to any additional rights with
        respect to any other corporation, company, or entity.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> 6. Acceptable Use/Restrictions</p>
      <p class="p-2">You may not use the DENS or Token:</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        1. in any way that breaches any applicable local, national or
        international law or regulation;
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        2. in any way that is unlawful or fraudulent or has any unlawful or
        fraudulent purpose or effect;

        3. for the purpose of exploiting, harming or attempting to harm children
        in any way;

        5. to knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that
        contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers,
        spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code
        designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or
        hardware; and
      </p>
      <p class="p-2"> 6. to upload terrorist content; </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        {' '}
        7. to impersonate any other person or search for and publish private or
        identifying information about a particular individual (doxxing); or
      </p>

        {' '}
        8. in any other way as restricted by us from time to time.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">Other terms</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        If a court or other authority decides that some of these Terms are
        unlawful, the rest will continue to apply.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        Even if we delay in enforcing any of our rights under these Terms, we
        can still enforce them later.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">
        If any paragraph or clause of these Terms is deemed unenforceable or
        unlawful, then that provision shall not apply (be severed), but the rest
        of the Terms will continue to apply.
      </p>
      <p class="p-2">Applicable laws</p>
      <p class="p-2">
        These Terms, their subject matter and their formation (and any
        non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by English law and by
        using DENS or holding a Token, we both agree to the exclusive
        jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
